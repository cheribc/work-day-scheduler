# jQuery-scheduler
#### What?
This is a simple jQuery plugin that allows for creation of events/appointments/reservations with clicking and dragging of the mouse. It provides a day view calendar with timeslots for multiple reservation items. Implementing is quick, and requires little development on the user's part. It is still in development with a lot of stuff to add, so this is only for demonstration purposes.
#### Why?
This plugin was started because of the lack of simple day schedulers available. There is an abundance of full month calendar views, but nothing for a single day. I was working on a project for school that would create a reservation system for our 3d printers, but couldn't find anything to display reservations. This project is what I wish I had found 6 months a go.

Big thanks to [jacwright](https://github.com/jacwright) for writing the [date.format library](https://github.com/jacwright/date.format) I used to help deal with that pesky javascript date object.
